# Reflection on GitHub Collaboration - [Katie Walker]

## GitHub Pull & Push
Explain the concepts of pulling from and pushing to repositories on GitHub contribute to the functionality of distributed version control systems.

The ability to pull and push repositories on github allows many users to access and update a github repository at the same time without having to download all of the files locally onto their computer. They can access and manage all of the files remotely from the github repository.

## Experiencing GitHub Branches
Describe your experience working with GitHub branches.

Working with branches on github at first can be a little confusing at first and its definetly not as easy as doing everything locally, but its not too hard that would make it a bad method to use for ease of use between multiple people it is a great product to use.

## GitHub Flow
Provide an overview of GitHub Flow.

The flow of github allows you to create new branches, make changes and new commits, open pull requests to pull new changes, it allows you to review and deploy new changes, and it allows you to merge new changes to the main file. All of this can be done on github rather than from your local computer.
